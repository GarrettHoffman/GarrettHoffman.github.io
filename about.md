I'm an Actuary and Data Scientist with an interest in using what we know or can learn about how the world works to drive optimal decisions, experiences and outcomes. 

### More Information

I have an accademic background in Pure Mathematics and Finance.  For over 4 years, Iâ€™ve been helping businesses navigate through the risks and opportunities facing their employee retirement schemes. I am eager to bring new analytical techniques to the forefront of the retirement landscape to ensure that employees have the best opportunity to be financially ready for retirement. 

Other interests include playing Basketball, Soccer, and Tennis, going to the park with my dog, spending a sunny day at the beach, and listening to live music at a new venue.
